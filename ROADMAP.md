# CosySim Roadmap

> Current: **v0.69** | Last updated: 2026-03-02

## Philosophy

CosySim is a **meta-system** — a playground for designing, testing, benchmarking, and evolving AI agent interactions. Every scene is a self-contained experiment combining agents, state, game logic, and UI. The framework exists so that agents (and humans) can methodically explore what works, feed results back into the system, and continuously improve.

The system's ultimate goal: **inhabit itself** — AI agents that maintain, improve, and expand CosySim autonomously, guided by Nexus knowledge, NotebookLM intelligence, and fine-tuned local models.

## Active: v0.70 — "The Character Web"

> The scenes are alive and ticking. Now make them worth living in.
> Deep character interactions, real story arcs, faction politics, economy loops,
> and a first-class finetuning cycle that produces models the system actually uses.

### Track A: Scene Gameplay Deepening
- [ ] All 9 active scenes get deeper game loops — real win/lose states, progression, rewards
- [ ] Economy fully wired: EconomyManager drives prices, faction bonuses, scene-specific events
- [ ] ConsequenceStore surfaced in UI — past decisions shown, future consequences telegraphed
- [ ] Story arc system: 3-act arcs per scene, NLM-generated, tracked in CharacterMemory

### Track B: Character Relationship Web
- [ ] Character relationship graph: CharacterMemory stores per-character opinion scores
- [ ] NPC reaction system: characters respond differently based on relationship/reputation
- [ ] Faction alignment visible in scene UI — player standing with each faction
- [ ] Character backstory generation via NLM, stored in Nexus, surfaced on hover/inspect

### Track C: First Live Finetuning Cycle
- [ ] Run router_v3 finetune job on Qwen3-0.6B (FinetuneOrchestrator.start_job)
- [ ] Auto-benchmark vs rule_predictor baseline
- [ ] Auto-promote to ModelRegistry if improved; swap into InferenceRouter
- [ ] Log result in Nexus; scheduler runs weekly thereafter

### Track D: Voice + TTS Hardening
- [ ] Verify TTS works in all 9 scenes (Piper / Orpheus / Qwen3 backends)
- [ ] Global TTS/STT on/off toggle in admin overlay + persisted to localStorage
- [ ] Voice profile per character (pitch, speed, backend stored in CharacterMemory)
- [ ] STT input on all scenes with push-to-talk mode

### Track E: Document Overhaul
- [ ] Full documentation pass: update all 26 docs to v0.69 reality
- [ ] New: SCENE_GUIDE.md (per-scene game mechanics reference)
- [ ] New: CHARACTER_SYSTEM.md (memory, relationships, arcs)
- [ ] New: FINETUNING_GUIDE.md (end-to-end from dataset to live router)
- [ ] SYSTEM_AUDIT.md → v0.70 honest grade

### Track F: Nexus Deepening
- [ ] Seed Nexus with per-scene character lore, faction descriptions, world lore
- [ ] NLM weekly scene-lore seeder (scheduler task) — 50+ entries per cycle
- [ ] Nexus search exposed in admin overlay (live scene-side search panel)
- [ ] All scene skills query Nexus for context before responding

## Architecture Principles

1. **Everything through MCP** — Skills, state, events, and cross-system communication all go through the MCP pipeline
2. **Nexus as truth** — Prompts, rules, configurations, session history, and experiment results live in Nexus
3. **NLM-first** — Research, analysis, and knowledge generation go through NotebookLM (free Gemini) before LMStudio
4. **Local-first** — No cloud dependencies. LMStudio, ChromaDB, ComfyUI, TTS all run locally
5. **Test-driven** — Every feature gets tests. 6,921 passing at v0.69
6. **Scene independence** — Scenes are self-contained. Adding a scene shouldn't break others
7. **Agent freedom within rails** — Governance pipeline enforces consistency without killing creativity
8. **Profile-aware** — Conversation analyzer builds persistent user profile; all agents use it
9. **Self-improving** — Scheduler runs autonomously: news fetch, QA mining, benchmark cycles, fine-tuning
10. **Voice-first** — Every character speaks. Every input has a mic. TTS/STT on every scene
