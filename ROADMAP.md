# CosySim Roadmap

> Current: **v0.59b** | Last updated: 2026-02-27

## Philosophy

CosySim is a **meta-system** — a playground for designing, testing, benchmarking, and evolving AI agent interactions. Every scene is a self-contained experiment combining agents, state, game logic, and UI. The framework exists so that agents (and humans) can methodically explore what works, feed results back into the system, and continuously improve.

## Architecture Principles

1. **Everything through MCP** — Skills, state, events, and cross-system communication all go through the MCP pipeline
2. **Nexus as truth** — Prompts, rules, configurations, session history, and experiment results live in Nexus
3. **Local-first** — No cloud dependencies. LMStudio, ChromaDB, ComfyUI, TTS all run locally
4. **Test-driven** — Every feature gets tests. Current: 4,747 CosySim tests
5. **Scene independence** — Scenes are self-contained. Adding a scene shouldn't break others
6. **Agent freedom within rails** — Governance pipeline enforces consistency without killing creativity
7. **Nexus-first workflow** — Search Nexus before coding, store decisions after. Audit results always go to Nexus
